Open Source Versus Commercial Licenses for Roakvar

Affero GPL:
If you use Roakvar under the Affero GPL to integrate parts of it, then you are not allowed to sell 
copies of the modified program commercially. These requirements are the condition for including the
GPL-covered code you received in a program of your own.

Please check the suitability of Affero GPL for your project. Requirements imposed by the Affero GPL 
may affect the release of your software.

If you do not wish to use Roakvar under the Affero GPL, then we recommend to obtain a commercial 
license for the commercial edition of Roakvar available for purchase from Oak Bioinformatics, LLC.

A standard edition commercial-use license can be purchased for commercial product development. 
This license does not impose the Affero GPL open source licensing terms, conditions, and limitations. 
The license is a royalty-free, perpetual license to use Roakvar for application development, 
using the update version of Roakvar during one year. Also an enterprise license is available 
for purchase, you can send mail to rkim@oakbioinformatics.com for more infomation.
